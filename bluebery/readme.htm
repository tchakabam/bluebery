  <h2><span class="style2">or how to position content in 3 dimensions </span></h2>
</div>
<p>Content can be positioned on a 3-axis-system. We will call these axes key, type and language. Additionally we will add a time-dependent factor that effects each point in this space. That means that for</p>
<p>each point determined by the values of the variables that scale our axes their exists differentiable content for any point on the time-axis. Every possible point in our  3-axis plus time system represents a link to an information. Therefore we will call the points in the information-space-time entities.Every entity holds an information that can be represented with a number. Bluebery is an implementation of such a system using php as a frontend to in-and output values that are stored in a mySQL table wich is used to represent the timespace. The table has a column for each axis including the time-axis plus a column where the information that should hold every entity is stored. So here, an entity is namely an SQL row. </p>
